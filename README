This is the project jcom.

Its aim is to contain various utility Perl (but not only) software packages that are common
to all my development projects.

If you're interested in participating, drop me a note at jerome@eteve.net

It contains:

JCOM-DB
  
   A Perl package that contains some database specific classes and role to use and to consume in
   your own database classes. At the moment, it's Postgresql oriented.
